Questions
---------

1.  Jefferson wrote _Notes on the State of Virginia_ in response to a specific set of French queries. The book's focus is Virginia, not the entire nation, and it includes remarks on geography, flora and fauna, climate, and other topics not usually thought of as central to the history of nations. But as Waldstreicher notes in his introduction, this text narrates a particular "American story" that proved highly useful to subsequent definitions of the American nation. Why is _Notes_ a blueprint of sorts for writing a history of the American nation?
    
2.  A century later, the academic historian Frederick Jackson Turner also wrote a book that proved highly influential in shaping American national identity. Why did historians and other readers find Turner's vision compelling at the end of the nineteenth century?
    
3.  Using the examples of _Notes_ and _The Significance of the Frontier in American History_, discuss the strengths and limitations of national history. Is the nation a useful unit of historical analysis?
