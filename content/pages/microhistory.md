Questions
---------

Using the example of _The Would-Be Commoner_, discuss the advantages and disadvantages of micro-historical methodology. How is this perspective more satisfying than the national, borderlands, and global approaches we have studied in recent weeks? In what ways is it less compelling? (Don't worry about being critical - _The Would-Be Commoner_ will likely be my only foray into micro-history, and I am acutely aware of the book's shortcomings.)
