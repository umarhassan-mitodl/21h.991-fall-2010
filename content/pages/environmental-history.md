Questions
---------

1.  _Changes in the Land_ is a work of environmental history. As he writes about the history of the natural environment, what questions does William Cronon pose that other historians we have read this term have not asked? What methodologies does he employ that we have not yet encountered? What types of sources and archives does he study that we have not previously seen exploited?
    
2.  What is the relation, if any, of the pieces by Anderson, McNeill, and Ritvo to Cronon's work? In what ways do they build on Cronon's historical and methodological insights, and in what ways do they set out in new directions?
